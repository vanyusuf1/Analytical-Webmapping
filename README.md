# Webmapping

• Collaborated webmaps to create and improve the webmapping experience.

• Worked on Integrating Map Box to frontend to provide visualization of datapoint on maps and implementing webmapping using Leaflet -JS library.

• Included points (addresses and locations), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part
   collections of these types using GeoJSON.
